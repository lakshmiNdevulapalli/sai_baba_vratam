    Shri Ashok Kumar Ji had a hosiery business. The family had himself, wife, and a young son. The business was going 
    fine, although it was not huge. It was good enough for the comfortable living of the family. The trouble never comes 
    with a knock on our door. In his business, lending money to others was necessary. Otherwise, he would be left behind 
    in competition. So Ashok Kumar Ji lent gradually to another businessman 4 lakhs of rupees. That businessman became 
    dishonest and started avoiding and ignoring to pay back to Ashok Kumar Ji. Ashok Kumar Ji was very depressed and 
    started getting summons from companies one by one, as per them if Ashok Kumar Ji did not pay money to them, the 
    companies would not supply the raw material to him. Ashok Kumar Ji was having sleepless nights, he was not able to 
    get taste out of food nor he was interested in anything.<br><br>
    
    Once he was sitting with all his tensions and then it so happened that his friend Sharma Ji had come. On asking by 
    Sharma Ji, Ashok Kumar Ji told him about his problem and the reason for his tension. On listening to this Sharma Ji 
    said, “That’s your problem, it’s so simple. Ashok leave all your tensions and problems and surrender yourself to Sai 
    Baba’s feet. Start doing “Shri Sai Vrat” on Thursdays. In this Kaliyug, this fast gives you results in no time. 
    Start doing it with all happiness, faith, and patience and just wait for the miracle to happen.” After reciting all 
    this Sharma Ji had given one copy of “Shri Sai Vrat” to Ashok Ji and explained the Vrat procedures to him.<br><br>
    
    Ashok Kumar Ji with his wife started doing the fast keeping Faith and Patience in Sai Baba. Just after 4 days of 
    starting the Vrat, the same businessman came to Ashok Kumar Ji’s shop and said to him that he had very good profit 
    after selling his stock in the market and that he needed the next order really fast. He paid all the money which he 
    took on credit from him and on top of that he paid the next month cash in advance. He was asking Ashok Kumar Ji to 
    forgive him for the delayed payment of his debt. After seeing the blessings of Sai like this Ashok Kumar Ji was out 
    of this world, the amount he was thinking as bad debts, that which could never be recovered, had come back and his 
    business had also grown well. He thought that by doing the unique vrat, everyone should get benefited. He 
    distributed 200 copies of “Shri Sai Baba Vrat” to all his relatives and closed ones.<br>
