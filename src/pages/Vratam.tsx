            Always begin this vrat with faith and confidence, and never perform
            it with ill feelings in your heart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone can observe this fast, including women, men, and even
            children.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you start the vrat, make a promise to complete either 5, 7, 9,
            11, or 21 fasts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not remain on an empty stomach during this fast. You can have
            fruits, sweets, or any permissible food for fasting and may also
            have one full meal. Never observe this fast on an empty stomach.

            You can begin this vrat on any Thursday, placing Sai Baba‚Äôs photo or
            idol before you, lighting a lamp and incense sticks, and praying for
            your wish with a pure heart.

            The ‚ÄúShri Sai Baba Vrat‚Äù can be observed during Shradh (the period

          </li>
          <li>
            If you miss a Thursday for any reason, do not worry. Just skip that
            Thursday and continue your fast the following week. Do not let
            doubts cloud your heart; continue with faith and patience.
          </li>
          <li>
            After your wish is fulfilled and you have completed the fast,
            perform the Udyapan (Finishing Ceremony). Once done, you may start
            the ‚ÄúShri Sai Baba Vrat‚Äù again for a new wish, beginning on any
            Thursday.
